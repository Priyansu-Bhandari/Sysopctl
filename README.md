# sysopctl - System Operations Control Command

## Overview
`sysopctl` is a custom command-line tool designed for managing system resources, processes, and services on macOS. The tool simplifies system administration tasks by providing a single interface to perform various operations, such as viewing system load, managing services, and monitoring processes.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:

```bash
projectcmd/
│
├── sysopctl       # The main Bash script for sysopctl command
└── README.md      # This README file
```
## Problem Solving Approach
The sysopctl command was developed to address the need for a streamlined and efficient way to manage system resources on macOS. The approach focused on creating a simple, user-friendly command-line tool that integrates various system management tasks into a single interface.

The `sysopctl` command was developed to address the need for a streamlined and efficient way to manage system resources on macOS. The approach focused on creating a simple, user-friendly command-line tool that integrates various system management tasks into a single interface.

### Key Considerations:
- **Simplicity:** The tool is designed to be easy to use with a clear and intuitive syntax.
- **Modularity:** Each feature (e.g., service management, system load monitoring) is implemented as a separate command within `sysopctl`, making it easy to extend and maintain.
- **Compatibility:** The tool is built specifically for macOS, utilizing native macOS commands like `launchctl`, `uptime`, and `df`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- macOS
- Basic knowledge of using the terminal
- Bash shell

### Setup Instructions

#### Clone the Repository
If you haven't already created your project directory, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd projectcmd
```


### Create the Script File
The main script file is named `sysopctl`. If you haven't created it yet, use the following commands:

```bash
touch sysopctl
chmod +x sysopctl
```

### Edit the Script
Open the script in a text editor:

```bash
nano sysopctl
```
Add the basic structure for the command as described in the earlier steps. The script handles various options like --help, --version, and subcommands for managing services, system load, etc.

### Add the Script to PATH
To make sysopctl accessible from anywhere in the terminal, add the directory to your PATH. Add the following line to your .bash_profile or .zshrc:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/projectcmd
```
After editing, run:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile  # or source ~/.zshrc
```
## Usage
sysopctl provides several commands to manage system resources. Here’s how you can use it:

### Display Help
```bash
sysopctl --help
```
This command displays the help message, listing all available options and subcommands.

### Display Version
```bash
sysopctl --version
```
This command displays the current version of the sysopctl tool.

### Service Management
List Active Services:
```bash
sysopctl service list
```
Lists all active services using launchctl list.

Start a Service:
```bash
sysopctl service start <service-name>
```
Starts a specified service using launchctl start <service-name>.

Stop a Service:
```bash
sysopctl service stop <service-name>
```
Stops a specified service using launchctl stop <service-name>.

System Load
```bash
sysopctl system load
```
Displays the current system load averages, similar to the output of the uptime command.

Disk Usage
```bash
sysopctl disk usage
```
Shows disk usage statistics by partition, similar to the df -h command.

Process Monitoring
```bash
sysopctl process monitor
```
Monitors real-time process activity, providing a view similar to the top command.

Log Analysis
```bash
sysopctl logs analyze
```
Summarizes recent critical log entries, potentially using log show or journalctl.

Backup Files
```bash
sysopctl backup <path>
```
Initiates a backup of the specified directory, potentially using rsync.
